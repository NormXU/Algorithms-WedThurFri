Given a string with no duplicate characters, return a list with all permutations of the characters.

Assume that input string is not null.

**Examples**

Set = “abc”, all permutations are [“abc”, “acb”, “bac”, “bca”, “cab”, “cba”]

Set = "", all permutations are [""]







Given a rope with positive integer-length *n*, how to cut the rope into *m* integer-length parts with length *p*[0], *p*[1], ...,*p*[*m*-1], in order to get the maximal product of *p*[0] **p*[1]* ... **p*[*m*-1]? *m* **is determined by you** and must be greater than 0 **(at least one cut must be made**). Return the max product you can have.

**Assumptions**

- n >= 2

**Examples**

- n = 12, the max product is 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 81(cut the rope into 4 pieces with length of each is 3).
